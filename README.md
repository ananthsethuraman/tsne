tSNE--A Visualization Technique

## An Example of Visualization

We are familiar with maps (or atlases or charts).
A map represents continents, countries and the like as two-dimensional figures.
A continent, or a country have a three-dimensional topography.
For example, in the US, think to yourself how high the Rocky Mountains are, and how deep the Grand Canyon is.
That should convince you that the US (or for that matter any country) is a three-dimensional geometrical figure.
But on a map, the US is a two-dimensional gemetrical figure.
That is a good example of visualization.
